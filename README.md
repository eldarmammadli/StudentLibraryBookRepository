This project is a Spring Boot application designed for managing students, books, and libraries. The core CRUD operations are functional, and DTO/Payload structures facilitate data transfer.

Current status:
Add, view, edit, and delete operations are available for students, books, and libraries.
Some relationships (e.g., Student ↔ Book) and exception handling are not fully implemented yet.

Future plans:
Implement the relationship between students and books.
Refactor and optimize the code.
Add unit and integration tests.
